# The `changelog` LaTeX package

[Available on CTAN as `changelog`][changelog]

Changelogs are important. Unfortunately, there are few facilities
for typesetting changelogs in LaTeX. `changelog` defines a `changelog`
environment to make changelogs simple and intuitive.

Inspired by [keepachangelog.com].
